# libft

<h3>What is libft?</h3>
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

We re-create these functions in order to deepen our understanding of C. The general philosophy of 42 is that it's best to fully understand that machine that you're using and how it all works together. As a result, we avoid treating even these basic functions as black-boxes.

# get_next_line

<h3>What is get_next_line?</h3>

get_next_line is an individual project at 42 that basically reads a file line by line.

Disclaimer: There are so many easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my libft and only the standard functions ***read, malloc and free***.

# ft_printf

This project is a copy of the original printf function of C langage.

**Converts:** %d / %s / %p / %D / %i / %o / %O / %u / %U / %x / %X / %c / %%

**Flags:** # / 0 / - / + / [space]
